Hybrid, must be onsite 3 days a week. 8 hours a day, may work earlier in the day or later in the day based on working with EMEA. 1 year contract, might be able to extend, but not promised. Must have 3 years exp. Predicting health behaviors and suggesting behaviors to the world (for example suggesting lung screenings) Data Analytics (predictive modeling) Using multiple/big datasets to generate business (ex - SCALA & SPARK) Evidence of translating data analytics within applied healthcare setting Analyze healthcare data, run descriptive statistics, generate prior distributions, explore relationships: Correlation, covariance, causality, structural equation modeling, and build Bayesian Influence diagrams. Develop predictive models with Deep Learning networks, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, SVM, LDA, decision tree, and logistic regression using both generative and discriminative algorithms. Sub-group analysis: clustering, agglomerative clustering, graph-based clustering, and PCA analysis. Define and develop features, selections (Ridge/Lasso), and ranking. Standardize nominal, categorical, and numerical data to ensure data integrity. Develop algorithms in order to achieve the desired health outcomes, and improved health behavior in Big data environment SPARK and SCALA. Partner with scientists and business leaders to collect and organize healthcare data, and generate insights for thought leadership. Work with project leaders to roll out algorithms and build dashboards to visualize near real-time insights for targeted audience including scientists and commercial partners.
