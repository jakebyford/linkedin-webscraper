 Accurately implement methods described in technical documentation developed by our researchers.  Develop accompanying infrastructure to make the models and analytics developed accessible via a variety of access patterns.  Test all software being developed for accuracy and stability.  A bachelors, masters, or PhD in computer science or similar software engineering focused major. A second major, minor, or degree in an adjacent quantitative discipline, such as math, engineering, or physics is a big plus.
